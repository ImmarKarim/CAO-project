# CAO-project
This is a Smart Garage System that will help users park their cars safely.

The project lets the driver know how much space is there before the car hits the wall from the front.

Three zones:

  The project first detects the car when it is 15cm away - called the Low Danger zone. A green light Turns on.
  The project then detects the car when it is 1ocm away - called the Medium Danger zone. A Yellow light Turns on.
  The project then detects the car when it is 5cm away - called the High Danger zone. A Red light Turns on.
